### Project Description

The goal is to build an application that employees can use internally to create and vote polls. So, every employee can access the application and create a poll with two proposed solutions. They can create a poll on a form and In the Dashboard Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes. The process goes like this: An employee is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.
There is also a Leaderboard that lists every employee ordered by the number of polls they've created and answered.
The user can impersonate an employee on the login page with a username and password.
